# Dalton's Design Course Site
### *June 2021 Edition*

Every year it's nice to step back and take the latest HTML/CSS crash course tutorial from [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignCourse).

[This year's course](https://youtu.be/D-h8L5hgW-w) promises to be just as good as last years, so that's what this repository is for -- the course, and the code that arises from it.
